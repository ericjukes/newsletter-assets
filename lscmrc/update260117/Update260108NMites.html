      <h2>Northern Mites: Spotting mites at shows; Why infra-red won’t help; and what might</h2>
      <img src="northernmites.jpg" alt="Northern mites illustration">
      <div class="summary">
        <p>Early in 2025 reports were coming from the NMC of problems with mites (or particular fanciers with mice with mites ...) and the ndecessity of draconian rules with the Executive passing hurried and ill-thought-out diktats - red cards no longer being desired by the exhibitor as they had been transformed into an exhibitor death-warrant to be handed out by anti-mite officials.  Of course, when looked at calmly it is a common problem of breeding and exhibiting small livestock.  They are normally discovered by the judge and, certainly during my rather long stay in the mouse fancy, have been dealt with by the judge having a word with the show secretary and the show secretary having a quiet word with the exhibitor. In practice, what we most often encounter are tiny white specks in the coat, usually mites or their eggs, rather than fleas, which are rarer. But .... with modern technology is it possible to screen mice quickly and fairly for ectoparasites prior to judging?</p>
<p>The initial idea: an infra-red or similar “scanner”</p>
<p>It is tempting to imagine a gadget that could be passed over or under a mouse — perhaps infra-red (IR) or thermal — that would “flag” mites automatically. Such devices work well for larger targets: warm bodies, nests in buildings, or animals against cooler backgrounds. If mites were detectable as little hot dots, this would be ideal for a show environment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach fails for fundamental physical reasons.</p>
<p>Why infra-red (and thermal) won’t work</p>
<p>Fur mites and lice are extremely small, sit within the insulating fur, and are at or near the same temperature as the host’s skin. Thermal cameras do not have the spatial resolution or temperature contrast to distinguish a 0.2–0.5 mm organism from the surrounding warm fur. What the device “sees” is simply the mouse.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>the parasites are too small,</li>
<li>too close in temperature to the host,</li>
<li>and optically masked by fur.</li>
</ul>
<p>UV lighting fares little better. While UV-A (Wood’s lamp) is useful for certain skin and hair conditions, white mouse mites do not reliably fluoresce. Under UV you mostly see fur glow and reflections, which adds noise rather than clarity. UV can be used safely if desired, but it is not a dependable discriminator for white mites.</p>
<p>What actually works in practice</p>
<p>Show screening does not require laboratory certainty; it requires a reasonable, consistent method that can be applied quickly and defended if queried. For white mites, the key discriminator is not colour, but behaviour and attachment.</p>
<p>Effective methods share three features:</p>
<p>1. Bright white light</p>
<p>2. Low magnification</p>
<p>3. Ability to observe movement or attachment</p>
<p>Under these conditions, mites can be seen moving independently, while lice eggs (nits) appear cemented to the hair shafts. Dandruff and dust do neither.</p>
<p>The most practical tools are therefore very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>A daylight LED magnifier (5×–10×)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hands-free magnifier lamps allow the fur to be parted and examined quickly. Movement becomes obvious, and the task can be standardised for stewards.</p>
<ul>
<li>A modest digital microscope (40×–150× usable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Used sparingly as a confirmation tool, this allows slow crawling mites or attached nits to be shown clearly on a phone or tablet screen. One unit per show is sufficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>A contrasting surface (black card or tray)</li>
</ul>
<p>A gentle ruffle of the coat over a dark surface makes white specks stand out instantly and costs nothing.</p>
<p>These methods are widely used in veterinary and laboratory settings for initial screening, precisely because they balance speed, safety, and reliability.</p>
<p>What to avoid</p>
<p>High-power microscopes slow things down and are unnecessary. UV-only scanning creates false confidence. Thermal and IR devices simply do not address the physics of the problem. Anything UV-C should be avoided altogether near animals.</p>
<p>The proposed show solution</p>
<p>For a show environment, the sensible answer is not a futuristic scanner but a small, standardised inspection station:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clamp-on LED magnifier lamp at the table</li>
<li>One USB or Wi-Fi digital microscope available for confirmation</li>
<li>A clear handling tube, black card, and consistent inspection points (neck/shoulders, rump, belly, tail base)</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup allows a 30-second, non-invasive check that is repeatable and fair. It does not claim veterinary diagnosis, but it does provide a rational basis for decisions.</p>
<p>A defensible policy position</p>
<p>Crucially, the approach should be framed correctly. The inspection is a show-standard visual screening, not a medical examination. Decisions are based on observed movement or attachment under magnification, using white light. Infra-red and UV are explicitly not relied upon.</p>
<p>This keeps expectations realistic, avoids gadget-driven disputes, and aligns the method with what actually works.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The appeal of an infra-red “mite detector” is understandable, but it is a technological dead-end for this problem. White mouse mites are best detected the old-fashioned way: good light, modest magnification, and trained observation. By adopting a simple, visible, and standardised inspection setup, shows can manage the issue efficiently, safely, and credibly — without pretending that a magic scanner exists!</p>
