<h2 id="annual-cup-mice">Annual Cup Show (Mice)</h2>
<div class="img"><img src="TSales20251206Harlow.jpg" alt="Annual Cup Show (Mice)"></div>
<p>I very much enjoyed judging the club's annual cup show for mice. The task was made so much easier by the able stewarding of Derek. I thank him for that. Well done also to Rob who was acting show secretary for the first time. It all appeared to run smoothly at the show. I'm sure Eric's help and guidance in addition to his own contribution of organisation and hard work was of great help to him. Thanks to Pete for the tea and food.</p>
<p>The mice were a mixed bunch ranging in quality. Some sections weren't particularly well represented. The main winners were creditable. I particularly liked the well satinised Satin section winner along with a very nice Agouti and a well turned out Cinnamon. The best in show Black was a great example of the variety and in very good condition.</p>
<p>I hope everyone had a great day and here's to next year's shows being just as good.</p>

<h2 id="annual-cup-rats">Annual Cup Show (Rats)</h2>
<div class="img"><img src="RatAnnualCupShow_Degrange.jpg" alt="Annual Cup Show (Rats)"></div>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to judge the Annual Cup show, and thank you for all of the lovely entries. Best in Show went to a cream buck owned by Rivendell who is a very good all-rounder (the photo doesn't do him justice) and Gingerbread's Champagne kitten buck was Best Opposite Age. Reserve Best in Show went to a stunning silver fawn doe also from Rivendell who just lacked some muscle-tone.</p>

<p>The “cutting edge” and “state of the art” technology have become clichés in claims from various organisations, but be assured that the LSCMRC can make such claims and justify them. Even our two friends in the image above are not too far from the truth ... This entire “new” (for us) form of communication has been designed using a single prompt to AI (albeit a very lengthy one!)</p>
<p>But I do wish you a Happy and Traditional Christmas, before LSC launches its exciting new developments in 2026.</p>
